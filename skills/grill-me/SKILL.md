# grill-me

Interview the user relentlessly about a plan or design until every branch of the decision tree is resolved and understanding is shared.

Runs BEFORE a plan solidifies: extract the open decisions, resolve them. This is not plan mode (which explores and proposes without forcing per-decision resolution) and not the premortem rule (which runs after a rough decision: "imagine it failed, why"). Grill first, then plan or implement.

## Trigger

User-explicit only: "grill me", "interrogate this plan", "stress-test this design", "/grill-me". Never auto-invoke.

## Mechanics

- Ask **one question at a time**. Wait for the answer before the next.
- For **every** question, give your recommended answer with a one-line reason.
- If a question is answerable from the codebase, **go read the codebase** instead of asking.
- Walk the decision tree branch by branch. Resolve dependencies between decisions in order, so a settled decision constrains the ones downstream of it.

## Stop condition

Stop when every branch is resolved and you and the user share the same picture of the plan.

## Closing artifact

When done, emit a short **Resolved decisions** summary:

- One bullet per settled decision (the answer, not the deliberation)
- A short **Open / deferred** list for anything punted

Keep it a bullet list, not a template. It should drop straight into a plan or implementation.

## Credit

Adapted from **Matt Pocock's** `grill-me` skill (github.com/mattpocock/skills). The interrogation pattern is his; this version adds fleet conventions, a stop condition, and the Resolved-decisions artifact.
